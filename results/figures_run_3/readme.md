These are the figure for simulation run one, originating in result notebooks [#3](Results_Iteration#3.ipynb) and [DataExplorer](DataExplorer.ipynb) notebook.
* Figures prefixed with 'boxplot_' are boxplots of the result data, aggregated for both experiment groups and for the polyglot subgroups of python and javascript polyglots
* There are secondary versions of the 'boxplot_' figure that are suffixed with '_no_outliers', these include the same data but hide outliers
* The other two figures show for the input data the number of java developers over their written loc and the number of polyglots over their Java loc / secondary language loc ration <br>
Note the improved resolution in the language ratio diagram for cases where there is more secondary language code than java code
