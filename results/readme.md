# Results folder
This folder includes logs and figures produces by the three analysis runs. See the result notebooks [#1](Results_Iteration#1.ipynb), [#2](Results_Iteration#2.ipynb), and [#3](Results_Iteration#3.ipynb) and the [DataExplorer](DataExplorer.ipynb) notebook for the origins of these files. For the runs see the [RepoAnalysis](RepoAnalysis.ipynb) notebook.

The three figures folders contain the figures that were created during the three analysis runs. This includes plots of the resulting data, such as box plots and lifecycle graphs, but also plots of the input data, such as developers over written lines of Java code. Additionally, this folder includes the log files of the three analysis runs. These can be used for further mining, e.g. to compare run times, but mostly act as reports on the runs. Note that some logs of failed runs are included for completeness.
